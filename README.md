## Installation

Use *your* favorite runtimepath/plugin manager, or place `substrata.vim` into
`~/.vim/colors/` for \*nix and `%userprofile%\vimfiles\colors\` for Windows.

## Usage

If you’re using a GUI, then Substrata should work out of the box. However, if you’re planning to use Substrata in a terminal, the terminal must support 24-bit colour, also known as True Colour. If you want other terminal output to match with Substrata, then set its colours to match the ones below:

| Colour     | Normal    | Bright    |
| ---        | ---       | ---       |
| Black      | `#2e313d` | `#5b5f71` |
| Red        | `#cf8164` | `#fe9f7c` |
| Green      | `#76a065` | `#92c47e` |
| Yellow     | `#ab924c` | `#d2b45f` |
| Blue       | `#8296b0` | `#a0b9d8` |
| Magenta    | `#a18daf` | `#c6aed7` |
| Cyan       | `#659ea2` | `#7dc2c7` |
| White      | `#b5b4c9` | `#f0ecfe` |
| Foreground | `#b5b4c9` |           |
| Background | `#191c25` |           |

A preset is included for iTerm.
